# BinRec
A novel User-Based Collabarotive Filtering approach, implemented in C++ 
This software has been used for the experimentation during the research work.
The parameters are the following:

- Number of rows and columns of input dataset.
- The training dataset, in CSV format (an example is included: ml-1m_3_90_10_Opt4.rar).
- The biclusters dataset, in CSV format (an example is included: ml-100k_Bin_3_90_10_Opt4_biclusters.rar).
- The Test dataset, in CSV format (an example is included:ml-100k_Bin_3_90_10_Opt4_TestPoints.csv).
- The binarize threshold value (Sv).
